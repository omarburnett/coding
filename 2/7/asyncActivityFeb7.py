#These questions are code agnostic (meaning it does not matter which coding language you are learning, you should be able to answer them. )
#In your own words, describe the difference between a "FOR" loop and a "WHILE" loop. Please make sure your response is written in a complete sentence.

#Describe a situation where you would use a WHILE LOOP in a computer program. Then, attempt to create your example in code.

#You have been hired by temple university to work on a graduation checker program. your program should be able to find the highest grade in a list.
#  Create a function that will loop through each number in the list and identify if it is the highest number. When your program finds the highest grade,
#  it should return a message telling the user what the highest grade is.

# a while loop should bwe use in a situation where a process is needed to be repeated for an repetitive process
